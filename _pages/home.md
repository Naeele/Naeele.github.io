### Who am I? 👀

I am a third-year PhD student in cybersecurity at the [Inria Centre at the University of Lille](https://www.inria.fr/en/inria-centre-university-lille), within the [CRIStAL laboratory](https://cristal.univ-lille.fr/?rubrique9), under the supervision of [Clémentine Maurice](https://cmaurice.fr/). My research focuses primarily on web-related side-channel vulnerabilities.

### What am I interested in?

- Cybersecurity (of course)
- Feminism
- Science communication and outreach
- Hiking, running, and strength training
- And, above all… bird-loving 🐦

### What do I do alongside research?

I am currently in my second year as treasurer of the [ADSL – Association of PhD Students in Sciences in Lille](https://linktr.ee/assoc.adsl), and I co-organize **MeEtYou – Meeting for Young Researchers** at Inria Lille.

### My plans for the future?

Beyond the obvious goals (publishing papers and defending my thesis), I am currently looking for a postdoctoral position in cybersecurity, whether in side-channel analysis or related areas, I am open to discussion. In the longer term, if life allows, my Plan A is to continue along an academic career path.

If you would like to discuss ideas, collaborate, or just chat, feel free to send me an email 😉
